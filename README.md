# java-quiz

Some small Java code examples for testing your Java knowledge.

At work we noticed that some developers didn't fully understand some
of the Java basics they were using day in day out. So we came up with
some code examples they could use to check their knowledge.

This repo is a spin-off. I'll add some comments and clojure code.
